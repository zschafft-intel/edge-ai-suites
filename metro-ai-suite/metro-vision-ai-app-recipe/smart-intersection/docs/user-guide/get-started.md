# Get Started

The Smart Intersection Sample Application is a modular sample application designed to help
developers create intelligent intersection monitoring solutions. By leveraging AI and sensor
fusion, this sample application demonstrates how to achieve accurate traffic detection,
congestion management, and real-time alerting.

To get started:
- **Set up the sample application**: use Docker Compose to quickly deploy the application in
  your environment.
- **Run a predefined pipeline**: execute a sample pipeline to see real-time transportation
  monitoring and object detection in action.
- **Access the application's features and user interfaces**: explore the Intel® SceneScape
  Web UI, Grafana dashboard, Node-RED interface, and DL Streamer Pipeline Server to monitor,
  analyze and customize workflows.
- **Consider Enabling Security features**: use hardware-based security measures to make your
  application safer.


## Setup and First Use

**Prerequisites**
- Verify that your system meets the [minimum requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md).
- Install Docker: [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Enable running docker without "sudo": [Post Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
- Install Git: [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).


1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b release-2026.0.0
     cd edge-ai-suites/metro-ai-suite/metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/
     ```

2. **Setup Application and Download Assets**:
   - Use the installation script to configure the application and download required models:
     ```bash
     ./install.sh smart-intersection
     ```

> **Note:** For environments requiring a specific host IP address (such as when using Edge
> Manageability Toolkit or deploying across different network interfaces), you can explicitly
> specify the IP address (Replace `<HOST_IP>` with your target IP address.):
> `./install.sh smart-intersection <HOST_IP>`

## Run the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   - Export admin password as environment variable:
     ```bash
     export SUPASS=$(cat ./smart-intersection/src/secrets/supass)
     ```

   - Download container images with Application microservices and run with Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```

   <details>
   <summary>
   Check Status of Microservices
   </summary>

   - The application starts the following microservices.
   - To check if all microservices are in Running state:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

   **Expected Services:**
   - Grafana Dashboard
   - DL Streamer Pipeline Server
   - MQTT Broker
   - Node-RED (for applications without Intel® SceneScape)
   - Intel® SceneScape services (for Smart Intersection only)

   </details>

2. **View the Application Output**:
   - Open a browser and go to `https://localhost/grafana/` to access the Grafana dashboard.
     - Change the localhost to your host IP if you are accessing it remotely.
   - Log in with the following credentials:
     - **Username**: `admin`
     - **Password**: `admin`
   - Check under the Dashboards section for the application-specific preloaded dashboard.
   - **Expected Results**: The dashboard displays real-time video streams with AI overlays
     and detection metrics.

## Access the Application and Components

### Application UI

Open a browser and go to the following endpoints to access the application. Use `<actual_ip>`
instead of `localhost` for external access:

> **Note:**
> - All services are accessed through the nginx reverse proxy at `https://localhost` with appropriate paths.
> - For passwords stored in files (e.g., `supass` or `influxdb2-admin-token`), refer to the respective secret files in your deployment under ./src/secrets (Docker) or chart/files/secrets (Helm).
> - Since the application uses HTTPS with self-signed certificates, your browser may display a certificate warning. For the best experience, use **Google Chrome** and accept the certificate.

- **URL**: [https://localhost](https://localhost)
- **Log in with credentials**:
    - **Username**: `admin`
    - **Password**: Stored in `supass`. (Check `./smart-intersection/src/secrets/supass`)

> **Note**:
> - After starting the application, wait approximately 1 minute for the MQTT broker to initialize. You can confirm it is ready when green arrows appear for MQTT in the application interface. Since the application uses HTTPS, your browser may display a self-signed certificate warning. For the best experience, use **Google Chrome**.

### Grafana UI

- **URL**: [https://localhost/grafana/](https://localhost/grafana/)
- **Log in with credentials**:
    - **Username**: `admin`
    - **Password**: `admin` (You will be prompted to change it on first login.)

### InfluxDB UI

- **URL**: [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086)
- **Log in with credentials**:
    - **Username**: `<your_influx_username>` (Check `./smart-intersection/src/secrets/influxdb2/influxdb2-admin-username`)
    - **Password**: `<your_influx_password>` (Check `./smart-intersection/src/secrets/influxdb2/influxdb2-admin-password`).

### NodeRED UI

- **URL**: [https://localhost/nodered/](https://localhost/nodered/)

### DL Streamer Pipeline Server

- **REST API**: [https://localhost/api/pipelines/status](https://localhost/api/pipelines/status)
  - **Check Pipeline Status**:
    ```bash
    curl -k https://localhost/api/pipelines/status
    ```


## Verify the Application

- **Fused object tracks**: in Scene Management UI, click on the Intersection-Demo card to
  navigate to the Scene. On the Scene page, you will see fused tracks moving on the map. You
  will also see greyed out frames from each camera. Toggle the "Live View" button to see the
  incoming camera frames. The object detections in the camera feeds will correlate to the
  tracks on the map.

- **Grafana Dashboard**: In Grafana UI, observe aggregated analytics of different regions of
  interests in the grafana dashboard. After navigating to Grafana home page, click on
  "Dashboards" and click on item "Anthem-ITS-Data".

## **Stop the Application**:
  - To stop the application microservices, use the following command:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

## Other Deployment Option

Choose one of the following methods to deploy the Smart Intersection Sample Application:

- **[Deploy Using Helm](./get-started/deploy-with-helm.md)**: Use Helm to deploy the
  application to a Kubernetes cluster for scalable and production-ready deployments.

## Security Enablement

With AI systems handling sensitive city data and making autonomous decisions, robust security
is essential. Intel platforms provide built-in security features to protect data, infrastructure,
and AI processing. See the [Security Enablement Guide](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/2026.0/OEP-articles/application-security.html)
that uses the example of Smart Intersection to show how to secure Open Edge Platform
applications.
