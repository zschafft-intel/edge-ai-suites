# Run Multiple Apps

- **Time to Complete:** 30 minutes
- **Programming Language:**  Python 3

## Prerequisites

- [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements.md)

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to simultaneously deploy and manage multiple industrial edge AI vision applications using Docker Compose. You'll learn to configure and run multiple instances of the same application or different applications in parallel, with each instance operating its own isolated DLStreamer Pipeline Server and associated services, all accessible through dedicated NGINX proxy configurations.

**What you'll learn:**

- How to configure multiple application instances with unique port assignments
- How to independently deploy, start, stop, and monitor multiple running applications
- How to access and view streams from each application instance

## Set up the Applications

1. Clone the **edge-ai-suites** repository and navigate to the `industrial-edge-insights-vision` directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b release-2026.0.0
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/
   ```

2. Create a `config.yml` file to define your application instances and their unique port configurations. Add the following sample contents and save.

   Example:

   ```text
   worker-safety-gear-detection:
     wsg1:
       NGINX_HTTP_PORT: 8080
       NGINX_HTTPS_PORT: 8443
       COTURN_UDP_PORT: 3478
       MINIO_SERVER_PORT: 8001
     wsg2:
       NGINX_HTTP_PORT: 9080
       NGINX_HTTPS_PORT: 9443
       COTURN_UDP_PORT: 3479
       MINIO_SERVER_PORT: 9001

   pallet-defect-detection:
     pdd1:
       NGINX_HTTP_PORT: 10080
       NGINX_HTTPS_PORT: 10443
       COTURN_UDP_PORT: 3480
       MINIO_SERVER_PORT: 10001
   ```

   > **Note:** A sample configuration file `sample_config.yml` is provided to help users understand the multi-instance setup and get started. This configuration defines three example instances with identifiers: pdd1, pdd2, and weld1. The accompanying sample scripts utilize these identifiers to perform operations on individual application instances.

3. Edit the environment variables below in `.env_<SAMPLE_APP>` files for all sample apps present in config.yml.

   For the example above, modify the envs for worker-safety-gear-detection and pallet-defect-detection i.e. env_worker-safety-gear-detection and .env_pallet-defect-detection

   ```text
   HOST_IP=<HOST_IP>   # IP address of server where DL Streamer Pipeline Server is running.

   MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=   # MinIO service & client access key e.g. intel1234
   MINIO_SECRET_KEY=   # MinIO service & client secret key e.g. intel1234

   MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME=<username>  # WebRTC credentials e.g. intel1234
   MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD=<password>
   ```

4. Install pre-requisites for all the instances:

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   This does the following:

   - Parses through the config.yml
   - Downloads resources for each instance
   - Creates a folder temp_apps/<SAMPLE_APP>/<INSTANCE_NAME> that contains configs folder, .env file and payload.json
   - Updates and adds the ports mentioned in config.yml to the respective .env file
   - Sets executable permissions for scripts

## Deploy the Applications

### Deploy all the application instances

1. Deploy all the instances given in config.yml:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh up
   ```

   It starts all the containers for each instance in `config.yml`

2. Verify all containers are running:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

## Start AI Pipelines

### Start pipeline for all instances

1. Fetch the list of pipelines for all instances:

   ```bash
   ./sample_list.sh
   ```

   The inference stream can be viewed on WebRTC, in a browser, at the following url depending on the SAMPLE_APP:

   > **Note:** The `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` is different for each instance of the sample app. For example, for the sample config mentioned previously, the instance wsg1 has nginx port set to 8443, wsg2 set to 9443 & pdd1 set to 10443.

   ```text
   https://<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>/mediamtx/pdd/              # Pallet Defect Detection

3. Check status of a particular instance_id of an instance

   ```bash
   ./sample_status.sh -i <INSTANCE_NAME> --id <INSTANCE_ID>
   ```

### Stop Docker Containers

1. Stop containers of all instances:

    ```bash
    ./run.sh down
    ```

2. Verify all containers are stopped:

    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```
3. Once application has been stopped, remove or rename the `config.yml` file if you do not wish to relaunch these multiple apps next time.
