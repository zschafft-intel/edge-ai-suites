# Deploy Multiple Instances with Helm

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the **minimum system requirements** for this application.
- K8s installation on single or multi node must be done as pre-requisite to continue the following deployment. Note: The kubernetes cluster is set up with `kubeadm`, `kubectl` and `kubelet` packages on single and multi nodes with `v1.30.2`.
  Refer to tutorials online to setup kubernetes cluster on the web with host OS as ubuntu 22.04 and/or ubuntu 24.04.
- For helm installation, refer to [helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Setup the application

> **Note**: The following instructions assume Kubernetes is already running in the host system with helm package manager installed.

1. Clone the **edge-ai-suites** repository and change into industrial-edge-insights-vision directory. The directory contains the utility scripts required in the instructions that follows.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b release-2026.0.0
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/
   ```

   > **Note**: These steps demonstrate launching two pallet-defect-detection instances and one weld-porosity instance. Modify the sample apps and instances as needed for your use case.

2. Create a `config.yml` file to define your application instances and their unique port configurations. Add the following sample contents and save.

    Example:

    ```bash
    pallet-defect-detection:
      pdd1:
        NGINX_HTTP_PORT: 30080
        NGINX_HTTPS_PORT: 30443
        COTURN_PORT: 30478
        S3_STORAGE_PORT: 30800
      pdd2:
        NGINX_HTTP_PORT: 30081
        NGINX_HTTPS_PORT: 30444
        COTURN_PORT: 30479
        S3_STORAGE_PORT: 30801

    weld-porosity:
      weld1:
        NGINX_HTTP_PORT: 30082
        NGINX_HTTPS_PORT: 30445
        COTURN_PORT: 30480
        S3_STORAGE_PORT: 30802
    ```

    > **Note:** A sample configuration file `sample_config.yml` is provided to help users understand the multi-instance setup and get started. This configuration defines three example instances with identifiers: pdd1, pdd2, and weld1. The accompanying sample scripts utilize these identifiers to perform operations on individual application instances.

3. Edit the below mentioned environment variables in all the `helm/values_<SAMPLE_APP>.yaml` files:

   ```yaml
   HOST_IP=<HOST_IP>   # IP address of server where DL Streamer Pipeline Server is running.

   MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=   # MinIO service & client access key e.g. intel1234
   MINIO_SECRET_KEY=   # MinIO service & client secret key e.g. intel1234

   MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_USERNAME=<username>  # WebRTC credentials e.g. intel1234
   MTX_WEBRTCICESERVERS2_0_PASSWORD=<password>
   ```
    > **Note:** For GPU/NPU based pipelines, set `privileged_access_required: true` in the `helm/values_<SAMPLE_APP>.yaml` file to enable access to host hardware devices.

4. Install pre-requisites for all instances

   ```sh
   ./setup.sh helm
   ```

   This does the following:
   - Parses through the config.yml
   - Downloads resources for each instance
   - Creates a folder helm/temp_apps/<SAMPLE_APP>/<INSTANCE_NAME> that contains configs folder, .env file, payload.json, Chart.yaml, pipeline-server-config.json and values.yaml.
   - Updates and adds the ports mentioned in config.yml to the respective values.yaml file
   - Sets executable permissions for scripts

## Deploy the application

### Install helm charts

1. Install the helm chart for all instances.

   ```sh
   ./run.sh helm_install
   ```

   After installation, check the status of the running pods for each instance:

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n <INSTANCE_NAME>
   ```

   To view logs of a specific pod, replace `<pod_name>` with the actual pod name from the output above:

   ```sh
   kubectl logs -n <INSTANCE_NAME> -f <pod_name>
   ```

2. Copy the resources such as video and model from local directory to the to the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod to make them available for application while launching pipelines.

   ```sh
   # Below is an example for Pallet Defect Detection. Please adjust the source path of models and videos appropriately for other sample applications.

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n <INSTANCE_NAME> -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp resources/pallet-defect-detection/videos/warehouse.avi $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n <INSTANCE_NAME>

   kubectl cp resources/pallet-defect-detection/models/* $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n <INSTANCE_NAME>
   ```

### Start AI pipelines

#### Start pipeline for all instances

1. Fetch the list of pipeline loaded available to launch for all instances

   ```sh
   ./sample_list.sh helm
   ```

   This lists the pipeline loaded in DLStreamer Pipeline Server.

## Uninstall Helm Charts

 ```sh
 ./run.sh helm_uninstall
 ```
Once application has been stopped, remove or rename the `config.yml` file if you do not wish to relaunch these multiple apps next time.

## Storing frames to S3 storage

Applications can take advantage of S3 publish feature from DL Streamer Pipeline Server and use it to save frames to an S3 compatible storage.

1. Run all the steps mentioned in above [section](#setup-the-application) to setup the application.

2. Install the helm chart.

   ```sh
   ./run.sh helm_install
   ```

3. Copy the resources such as video and model from local directory to the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod to make them available for application while launching pipelines.

   ```sh
   # Below is an example for Pallet Defect Detection. Please adjust the source path of models and videos appropriately for other sample applications.

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n <INSTANCE_NAME> -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp resources/pallet-defect-detection/videos/warehouse.avi $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n <INSTANCE_NAME>

   kubectl cp resources/pallet-defect-detection/models/* $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n <INSTANCE_NAME>
   ```

4. Install the package `boto3` in your python environment if not installed.

   It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install it there. You can run the following commands to add the necessary dependencies as well as create and activate the environment.

   ```sh
   sudo apt update && \
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
   ```

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv && \
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Once the environment is ready, install `boto3` with the following command

   ```sh
   pip3 install --upgrade pip && \
   pip3 install boto3==1.36.17
   ```

   > **Note:** DL Streamer Pipeline Server expects the bucket to be already present in the database. The next step will help you create one.

5. Create a S3 bucket using the following script.

   Update the `HOST_IP` and `S3_STORAGE_PORT` mentioned in config.yml for each instance and credentials with that of the running MinIO server. Name the file as `create_bucket_<INSTANCE_NAME>.py`.

   ```python
   import boto3
   url = "http://<HOST_IP>:<S3_STORAGE_PORT>"
   user = "<value of MINIO_ACCESS_KEY used in helm/temp_apps/SAMPLE_APP/INSTANCE_NAME/values.yaml>"
   password = "<value of MINIO_SECRET_KEY used in helm/temp_apps/SAMPLE_APP/INSTANCE_NAME/values.yaml>"
   bucket_name = "ecgdemo"

   client= boto3.client(
               "s3",
               endpoint_url=url,
               aws_access_key_id=user,
               aws_secret_access_key=password
   )
   client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
   buckets = client.list_buckets()
   print("Buckets:", [b["Name"] for b in buckets.get("Buckets", [])])
   ```

   Run the above script to create the bucket.

   ```sh
   python3 create_bucket_<INSTANCE_NAME>.py
   ```

6. Start the pipeline with the following cURL command  with `<HOST_IP>` set to system IP and the `<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>` mentioned in the config.yml for each instance. Ensure to give the correct path to the model as seen below. This example starts an AI pipeline for pallet_defect_detection.  Please adjust the source path of models and videos appropriately for other sample applications.

   ```sh
   curl -k https://<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>/api/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pallet_defect_detection_s3write -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
       "source": {
           "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
           "type": "uri"
       },
       "destination": {
           "frame": {
               "type": "webrtc",
               "peer-id": "pdds3"
           }
       },
       "parameters": {
           "detection-properties": {
               "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/pallet-defect-detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
               "device": "CPU"
           }
       }
   }'
   ```

7. Go to MinIO console on `https://<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>/minio/` and login with `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` provided in `helm/temp_apps/SAMPLE_APP/INSTANCE_NAME/values.yaml` file. After logging into console, you can go to `ecgdemo` bucket and check the frames stored.

   ![S3 minio image storage](../_assets/s3-minio-storage.png)

8. Uninstall the helm chart.

   ```sh
   ./run.sh helm_uninstall
   ```
9. Once application has been stopped, remove or rename the `config.yml` file if you do not wish to relaunch these multiple apps next time.

## MLOps using Model Download

1. Run all the steps mentioned in above [section](#setup-the-application) to setup the application.

2. Install the helm chart

   ```sh
   ./run.sh helm_install
   ```

3. Copy the resources such as video and model from local directory to the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod to make them available for application while launching pipelines.

   ```sh
   # Below is an example for Pallet Defect Detection. Please adjust the source path of models and videos appropriately for other sample applications.

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n <INSTANCE_NAME> -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp resources/pallet-defect-detection/videos/warehouse.avi $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n <INSTANCE_NAME>

   kubectl cp resources/pallet-defect-detection/models/* $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n <INSTANCE_NAME>
   ```

4. Modify the payload in `helm/temp_apps/<SAMPLE_APP>/<INSTANCE_NAME>/payload.json` to launch an instance for the mlops pipeline.

   Below is an example for pallet-defect-detection. Please modify the payload for other sample applications.

   ```json
   [
       {
           "pipeline": "pallet_defect_detection_mlops",
           "payload":{
               "source": {
                   "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
                   "type": "uri"
               },
               "destination": {
               "frame": {
                   "type": "webrtc",
                   "peer-id": "pdd"
               }
               },
               "parameters": {
                   "detection-properties": {
                       "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/pallet-defect-detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
                       "device": "CPU"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   ]
   ```

5. Start the pipeline with the above payload.

   Below is an example for starting an instance for pallet-defect-detection:

   ```sh
   ./sample_start.sh helm -i <INSTANCE_NAME> -p pallet_defect_detection_mlops
   ```
   Note the instance-id.

6. Download and prepare the model. Below is an example for downloading and preparing model for pallet-defect-detection. Please modify MODEL_URL for the other sample applications.
   >NOTE- For sake of simplicity, we assume that the new model has already been downloaded by Model Download microservice. The following curl command is only a simulation that just downloads the model. In production, however, they will be downloaded by the Model Download service.

   ```sh
   export MODEL_URL='https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-resources/raw/06bb0d621cb14a1791672552a538beddddcc4066/models/INT8/pallet_defect_detection.zip'

   curl -L "$MODEL_URL" -o "$(basename $MODEL_URL)"

   unzip "$(basename $MODEL_URL)" -d new-model # downloaded model is now extracted to `new-model` directory.
   ```

7. Copy the new model to the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod to make it available for application while launching pipeline.

   ```sh

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n <INSTANCE_NAME> -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp new-model $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n <INSTANCE_NAME>
   ```
   >NOTE- If there are multiple sample_apps in config.yml, repeat steps 6 and 7 for each sample app and instance.


8. Stop the existing pipeline before restarting it with a new model. Use the instance-id generated from step 5.
   ```sh
   curl -k --location -X DELETE https://<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>/api/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

9. Modify the payload in `helm/temp_apps/<SAMPLE_APP>/<INSTANCE_NAME>/payload.json` to launch an instance for the mlops pipeline with this new model.

   Below is an example for pallet-defect-detection. Please modify the payload for other sample applications.

   ```json
   [
       {
           "pipeline": "pallet_defect_detection_mlops",
           "payload":{
               "source": {
                   "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
                   "type": "uri"
               },
               "destination": {
               "frame": {
                   "type": "webrtc",
                   "peer-id": "pdd"
               }
               },
               "parameters": {
                   "detection-properties": {
                       "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/new-model/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
                       "device": "CPU"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   ]

10. View the WebRTC streaming on `https://<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>/mediamtx/<peer-str-id>/` by replacing `<peer-str-id>` with the value used in the original cURL command to start the pipeline.
