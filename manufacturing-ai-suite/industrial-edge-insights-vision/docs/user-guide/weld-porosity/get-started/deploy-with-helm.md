# Deploy with Helm

## Prerequisites

- [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements.md)
- K8s installation on single or multi node must be done as pre-requisite to continue the following deployment. Note: The kubernetes cluster is set up with `kubeadm`, `kubectl` and `kubelet` packages on single and multi nodes with `v1.30.2`.
  Refer to tutorials online to setup kubernetes cluster on the web with host OS as ubuntu 22.04 and/or ubuntu 24.04.
- For helm installation, refer to [helm website](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Setup the application

> **Note**: The following instructions assume Kubernetes is already running in the host system with helm package manager installed.

1. Clone the **edge-ai-suites** repository and change into industrial-edge-insights-vision directory. The directory contains the utility scripts required in the instructions that follows.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git -b release-2026.0.0
   cd edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/
   ```

2. Set app specific values.yaml file.

   ```sh
   cp helm/values_weld-porosity.yaml helm/values.yaml
   ```
      > **Note:** For GPU/NPU based pipelines, set `privileged_access_required: true` in the `helm/values.yaml` file to enable access to host hardware devices.

3. Optional: Pull the helm chart and replace the existing helm folder with it
    - Note: The helm chart should be downloaded when you are not using the helm chart provided in `edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/helm`

    - Download helm chart with the following command

        `helm pull oci://registry-1.docker.io/intel/weld-porosity-sample-application --version 1.4.0`
    - unzip the package using the following command

        `tar -xvf weld-porosity-sample-application-1.4.0.tgz`
    - Replace the helm directory

        `rm -rf helm && mv weld-porosity-sample-application helm`
4. Edit the HOST_IP, proxy and other environment variables in `helm/values.yaml` as follows

   ```yaml
   env:
       HOST_IP: <HOST_IP>   # host IP address
       MINIO_ACCESS_KEY: <DATABASE USERNAME> #  example: minioadmin
       MINIO_SECRET_KEY: <DATABASE PASSWORD> #  example: minioadmin
       http_proxy: <http proxy> # proxy details if behind proxy
       https_proxy: <https proxy>
       SAMPLE_APP: weld-porosity # application directory
   webrtcturnserver:
       username: <username>  # WebRTC credentials e.g. intel1234
       password: <password>
   ```

5. Install pre-requisites. Run with sudo if needed.

   ```sh
   ./setup.sh helm
   ```

   This sets up application pre-requisites, download artifacts, sets executable permissions for scripts etc.

## Deploy the application

1. Install the helm chart

   ```sh
   helm install app-deploy helm -n apps --create-namespace
   ```

   After installation, check the status of the running pods:

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -n apps
   ```

   To view logs of a specific pod, replace `<pod_name>` with the actual pod name from the output above:

   ```sh
   kubectl logs -n apps -f <pod_name>
   ```

2. Copy the resources such as video and model from local directory to the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod to make them available for application while launching pipelines.

   ```sh
   # Below is an example for Weld Porosity Classification. Please adjust the source path of models and videos appropriately for other sample applications.

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n apps -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp resources/weld-porosity/videos/welding.avi $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps

   kubectl cp resources/weld-porosity/models/* $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps
   ```

3. Fetch the list of pipeline loaded available to launch

   ```sh
   ./sample_list.sh helm
   ```

   This lists the pipeline loaded in DL Streamer Pipeline Server.

   Output:

   ```text
   # Example output for Weld Porosity Classification
   Environment variables loaded from /home/intel/OEP/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
   Running sample app: weld-porosity

   Server reachable. HTTP Status Code: 200
   Loaded pipelines:
   [
       ...
       {
           "description": "DL Streamer Pipeline Server pipeline",
           "name": "user_defined_pipelines",
           "parameters": {
           "properties": {
               "classification-properties": {
               "element": {
                   "format": "element-properties",
                   "name": "classification"
               }
               }
           },
           "type": "object"
           },
           "type": "GStreamer",
           "version": "weld_porosity_classification"
       }
       ...
   ]
   ```

4. Start the sample application with a pipeline.

   ```sh
   ./sample_start.sh helm -p weld_porosity_classification
   ```

   This command would look for the payload for the pipeline specified in `-p` argument above, inside the `payload.json` file and launch the a pipeline instance in DL Streamer Pipeline Server. Refer to the table, to learn about different options available.

   Output:

   ```text
   # Example output for Weld Porosity Classification

   > **Note:**- This would start the pipeline. You can view the inference stream on WebRTC by opening a browser and navigating to https://<HOST_IP>:30443/mediamtx/weld/
   >If you're running helm using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 30443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.

   ### Starting GPU and NPU based pipelines
   For GPU and NPU based pipelines, ensure you have done the necessary [setup](../how-to-guides/use-gpu-for-inference.md#deploying-with-helm) from here, and start the respective pipelines as following.

      **For GPU-based pipelines:**

      ```sh
      ./sample_start.sh helm -p weld_porosity_classification_gpu
      ```

      **For NPU-based pipelines:**

      ```sh
      ./sample_start.sh helm -p weld_porosity_classification_npu
      ```

5. Get status of pipeline instance(s) running.

   ```sh
   ./sample_status.sh helm
   ```

   This command lists status of pipeline instances launched during the lifetime of sample application.

   Output:

   ```text
   # Example output for Weld Porosity Classification
   Environment variables loaded from /home/intel/OEP/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
   Running sample app: weld-porosity
   [
       {
           "avg_fps": 30.09161750097031,
           "elapsed_time": 2.3594603538513184,
           "id": "895130405c8e11f08b78029627ef9c6b",
           "message": "",
           "start_time": 1752042770.7844434,
           "state": "RUNNING"
       }
   ]
   ```

6. Stop pipeline instance.

   ```sh
   ./sample_stop.sh helm
   ```

   This command will stop all instances that are currently in `RUNNING` state and respond with the last status.

   Output:

   ```text
   # Example output for Weld Porosity Classification
   No pipelines specified. Stopping all pipeline instances
   Environment variables loaded from /home/intel/OEP/new/edge-ai-suites/manufacturing-ai-suite/industrial-edge-insights-vision/.env
   Running sample app: weld-porosity
   Checking status of dlstreamer-pipeline-server...
   Server reachable. HTTP Status Code: 200
   Instance list fetched successfully. HTTP Status Code: 200
   Found 1 running pipeline instances.
   Stopping pipeline instance with ID: 895130405c8e11f08b78029627ef9c6b
   Pipeline instance with ID '895130405c8e11f08b78029627ef9c6b' stopped successfully. Response: {

   "message": "",
   "start_time": 1752042770.7844434,
   "state": "RUNNING"
   }

    ```

   If you wish to stop a specific instance, you can provide it with an `--id` argument to the command.
   For example, `./sample_stop.sh helm --id 895130405c8e11f08b78029627ef9c6b`

7. Uninstall the helm chart.

   ```sh
   helm uninstall app-deploy -n apps
   ```

## Storing frames to S3 storage

Applications can take advantage of S3 publish feature from DL Streamer Pipeline Server and use it to save frames to an S3 compatible storage.

1. Run all the steps mentioned in the [section](#setup-the-application) above to setup the application.

2. Install the helm chart.

   ```sh
   helm install app-deploy helm -n apps --create-namespace
   ```

3. Copy the resources such as video and model from local directory to the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod to make them available for application while launching pipelines.

   ```sh
   # Below is an example for Weld Porosity Classification. Please adjust the source path of models and videos appropriately for other sample applications.

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n apps -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp resources/weld-porosity/videos/welding.avi $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps

   kubectl cp resources/weld-porosity/models/* $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps
   ```

4. Install the package `boto3` in your python environment if not installed.

   It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install it there. You can run the following commands to add the necessary dependencies as well as create and activate the environment.

   ```sh
   sudo apt update && \
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
   ```

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv && \
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Once the environment is ready, install `boto3` with the following command:

   ```sh
   pip3 install --upgrade pip && \
   pip3 install boto3==1.36.17
   ```

   > **Note** DL Streamer Pipeline Server expects the bucket to be already present in the database. The next step will help you create one.

5. Create a S3 bucket using the following script.

    Update the `HOST_IP` and credentials with that of the running MinIO server. Name the file as `create_bucket.py`.

   ```python
   import boto3
   url = "http://<HOST_IP>:30800"
   user = "<value of MINIO_ACCESS_KEY used in helm/values.yaml>"
   password = "<value of MINIO_SECRET_KEY used in helm/values.yaml>"
   bucket_name = "ecgdemo"

   client= boto3.client(
               "s3",
               endpoint_url=url,
               aws_access_key_id=user,
               aws_secret_access_key=password
   )
   client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
   buckets = client.list_buckets()
   print("Buckets:", [b["Name"] for b in buckets.get("Buckets", [])])
   ```

   Run the above script to create the bucket.

   ```sh
   python3 create_bucket.py
   ```

6. Start the pipeline with the following cURL command  with `<HOST_IP>` set to system IP. Ensure to give the correct path to the model as seen below. This example starts an AI pipeline.

>Note: If you're running helm using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 30443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.

   ```sh
   curl -k https://<HOST_IP>:30443/api/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/weld_porosity_classification_s3write -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
       "source": {
           "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/welding.avi",
           "type": "uri"
       },
       "destination": {
           "frame": {
               "type": "webrtc",
               "peer-id": "welds3"
           }
       },
       "parameters": {
           "classification-properties": {
               "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/weld-porosity/deployment/Classification/model/model.xml",
               "device": "CPU"
           }
       }
   }'
   ```

7. Go to MinIO console on `https://<HOST_IP>:30443/minio/` and login with `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY` and `MINIO_SECRET_KEY` provided in `helm/values.yaml` file. After logging into console, you can go to `ecgdemo` bucket and check the frames stored.
>Note: If you're running helm using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 30443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.

8. Uninstall the helm chart.

   ```sh
   helm uninstall app-deploy -n apps
   ```

## MLOps using Model Download

1. Run all the steps mentioned in the [section](#setup-the-application) above to setup the application.

2. Install the helm chart

   ```sh
   helm install app-deploy helm -n apps --create-namespace
   ```

3. Copy the resources such as video and model from local directory to the `dlstreamer-pipeline-server` pod to make them available for application while launching pipelines.

   ```sh
   # Below is an example for Weld Porosity Classification. Please adjust the source path of models and videos appropriately for other sample applications.

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n apps -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp resources/weld-porosity/videos/welding.avi $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps

   kubectl cp resources/weld-porosity/models/* $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps
   ```

4. Modify the payload in `helm/apps/weld-porosity/payload.json` to launch an instance for the mlops pipeline.

   ```json
   [
       {
           "pipeline": "weld_porosity_classification_mlops",
           "payload": {
               "destination": {
                   "frame": {
                       "type": "webrtc",
                       "peer-id": "weld"
                   }
               },
               "parameters": {
                   "classification-properties": {
                       "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/weld-porosity/deployment/Classification/model/model.xml",
                       "device": "CPU"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   ]
   ```

5. Start the pipeline with the above payload.

   ```sh
   ./sample_start.sh helm -p weld_porosity_classification_mlops
   ```
   Note the instance-id.

6. Download and prepare the model.
   >NOTE- For sake of simplicity, we assume that the new model has already been downloaded by Model Download microservice. The following curl command is only a simulation that just downloads the model. In production, however, they will be downloaded by the Model Download service.

   ```sh
   export MODEL_URL='https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-resources/raw/d7f7d4d6109ac977129e344ed2d730c430656feb/models/INT8/weld_porosity_classification.zip'

   curl -L "$MODEL_URL" -o "$(basename $MODEL_URL)"

   unzip "$(basename $MODEL_URL)" -d new-model # downloaded model is now extracted to `new-model` directory.
   ```

7. Run the following curl command to upload the local model.

   ```sh

   POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n apps -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}' | tr ' ' '\n' | grep deployment-dlstreamer-pipeline-server | head -n 1)

   kubectl cp new-model $POD_NAME:/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/ -c dlstreamer-pipeline-server -n apps
   ```

8. Stop the existing pipeline before restarting it with a new model. Use the instance-id generated from step 5.
>Note: If you're running helm using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 30443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.

   ```sh
   curl -k --location -X DELETE https://<HOST_IP>:30443/api/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

9. Modify the payload in `helm/apps/weld-porosity/payload.json` to launch an instance for the mlops pipeline with this new model

   ```json
   [
       {
           "pipeline": "weld_porosity_classification_mlops",
           "payload": {
               "destination": {
                   "frame": {
                       "type": "webrtc",
                       "peer-id": "weld"
                   }
               },
               "parameters": {
                   "classification-properties": {
                       "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/new-model/deployment/Classification/model/model.xml",
                       "device": "CPU"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   ]
   ```

10. View the WebRTC streaming on `https://<HOST_IP>:30443/mediamtx/<peer-str-id>/` by replacing `<peer-str-id>` with the value used in the original cURL command to start the pipeline.
>Note: If you're running helm using an `NGINX_HTTPS_PORT` other than the default 30443, replace `<HOST_IP>` with `<HOST_IP>:<NGINX_HTTPS_PORT>`.
